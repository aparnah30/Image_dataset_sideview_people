# Lower Body Side View Image Dataset and Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive dataset of lower body side-view images, annotated with keypoints for various body parts. The primary goal is to train machine learning models on this dataset to accurately detect and predict key body landmarks from side-view images.

### Keypoints Annotated

The dataset currently contains annotations for the following keypoints:

- **Waist Front**
- **Waist Back**
- **Hips Front**
- **Hips Back**
- **Above Knee Front**
- **Above Knee Back**
- **Calf Front**
- **Calf Back**
- **Ankle Front**
- **Ankle Back**
- **Feet**
- **Wrist Front**
- **Wrist Back**

## Dataset

The dataset consists of lower body side-view images of people, with each image carefully annotated to mark the above keypoints. These annotations are essential for training machine learning models to detect these keypoints in unseen images.

### Annotations

Each image in the dataset is annotated with the specific locations of the keypoints mentioned above.

## Work in Progress

### Model Training

I are currently in the process of training the dataset on the annotated keypoints. The objective is to develop a robust model that can accurately predict the keypoints in new side-view images of the lower body.

### Future Work

- **Data Augmentation:** To improve model generalization, I plan to apply various data augmentation techniques.
- **Model Optimization:** Post initial training, I will focus on optimizing the model's accuracy and efficiency.
- **Model Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation on test data to ensure the model performs well on diverse samples.
- **Model Deployment:** The final model will be deployed for real-time keypoint detection.
